## Ask Your Crush Out but web-dev style using React, Three.js!

This project is designed to add a touch of excitement and creativity to asking out your crush. Whether you're looking to impress or simply have fun, this project aims to make the experience memorable.

## Purpose

I developed this project as I seeked ideas to ask my crush out. I noticed a lack of engaging and unique ways to ask someone out. Most existing projects were either too simple or lacked the effort and creativity I wanted. Thus, I set out to create something special that could potentially make asking out my crush more memorable.
